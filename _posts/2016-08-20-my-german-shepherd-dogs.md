  I am the proud owner of German Shepherd Dogs (GSD). GSD are medium to large
  side dogs, They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong
  jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown with a lively,
  intelligent and self-assured look. The ears are large and stand erect, open at
  the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. They
  have a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a
  fast pace. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.

I am the proud owner of German Shepherd Dogs (GSD). GSD are medium to large side dogs, They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown with a lively, intelligent and self-assured look. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. They have a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.

German Shepherds have a two-layer coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants; medium and long. The long-hair gene is recessive, making the long-hair variety rarer. Treatment of the long-hair variation differs across standards; they are accepted but not competed with standard coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while they can compete with standard coated dogs but are considered a fault in the American Kennel Club. The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b---while short-haired type is listed as the variety.

Most commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic "saddle" to an over-all "blanket." Rarer colour variations include the sable, pure-black,pure-white, liver and blue varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows.

Nevertheless, the white GSD possess all of the same spirit and intelligence of a GSD, and should never been considered defective or impure. All of my GSD are an important members of my family.
