This litter was born Wednesday, August 24th, 2016\. They will be ready to go in early October 2016\.

I am looking for families that have owned GSD or dogs in general in the Fall of 2016  
I am looking for dog lovers who understand the adoption is for life and not at your convenience. My dogs are a beautiful and healthy bloodlines. I have three (3) generations of GSD, and all of them are happy, healthy and loving dogs. GSD make great family dogs, and I am picky about who adopts. They are not free nor an impulsive acquisition. Please contact me if you are a serious dog lover and good character.

_First pick of the litter_ $700.00 ($200 deposit, $500 at pickup)

_Reserve a dog_ for $600 ($100 deposit, with $500 at pickup)

I have a deposit form I can send you via email. You may call or text (517) 303 0627\. If I do not answer right away, I am unavailable and would be happy to respond via txt when my time frees up! Thanks.
