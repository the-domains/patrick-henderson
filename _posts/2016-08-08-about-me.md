About Me:

I am veteran, dog lover, _whiskey_ connosr, adventurer, and I endeavor to improve humanity through improving myself.

"_Character cannot be purchased, bargained for, rented or imported from afar_."

I am Michigan native, but I have lived all over the world in my life. From the southern United States, South Korea, Germany, and I was deployed to Kosovo in the late 1990s.

I also have a lot of credit hours from Michigan State University and Lansing Community College. I studied political science, military science, and computer networking among other things.
