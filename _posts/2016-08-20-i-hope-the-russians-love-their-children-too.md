# _'i hope the russians love their children too_'

Russian vodka, single barrel, single malt whiskey, red wine (chianti), mexican beer, and agave tequila are my indulgence. I do stray and make exceptions with _Stoli Raspberry_ Vodka ([STOLICHNAYA][0](r) Premium Vodka) with real berries (raspberries, blackberry, and strawberry) in the summer, and Bombay Sapphire gin and tonic in the summer months. Whiskey is my comfort and Scotch is my escape. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9976b2d4-70fa-439c-a5ea-2f69309f8066.jpg)

I imagine we all or some of us aspire to be [Don Draper, ][1]but I can appreciate a good bourbon in an old fashion or Manhattan. These classics remind me of a more civilized age. The [Old English Inn][2] in Eaton Rapids, Michigan serves a drink called the Churchill Manhattan that uses [Bullets Whiskey][3] and Cherry bitters from Wisconsin.
