Academics and Schools:

I have a lot of credit hours from [Michigan State University][0] and [Lansing Community College][1], but I am from [Haslett][2], Michigan.

From political science, military science, computer networking, and a pluthera of intellectual studies and certifications that I have learned and forgotten over the years; my greatest education was founded in years of experiences I have had as a soldier and technology professional.
